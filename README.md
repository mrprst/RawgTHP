# RAWG API

Playing with the RAWG API - https://api.rawg.io/docs/#tag/games

## What is is ?

This projet is a fully working Single Page Application made with Vanilla JS and Parcel bundler.
This website has two main pages:

- A Page list for the most anticipated videogames in the coming years
- A Page details for each game.

## Source

This project has been built with this template made for TheHackingProject bootcamp, [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VRJEUEv4Ybz9lI7NDFqMd2ctrPKUM6G8).

What I still have to do :

- fixing the header removed bug
- add recommended games
- add animations
- improve responsive

## How to launch

Just `git clone` the project
Launch it with `npm run start``
Enjoy :)
